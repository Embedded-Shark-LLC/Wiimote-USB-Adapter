This folder contains any CAD files for enclosures or other mechanical designs.

## 3D printing notes:

The enclosure files are designed with no tolerance for the PCB.  The button extension does have tolerance designed.  To avoid minor flexing of the enclosure base when the PCB is inserted, consider printing the part slightly larger (~102%).
